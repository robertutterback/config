#+TITLE: Miscellaneous Customizations

* Unfortunately, the "Edit with Emacs" extension doesn't seem to be
	working for me right now. So I've uninstalled edit-server.el.
	Maybe in a few months I'll try again; until then this code
	does nothing.
* Open "Edit with Emacs" using emacs daemon
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (and (daemonp) (locate-library "edit-server"))
    (require 'edit-server)
    (edit-server-start))
#+END_SRC

* Buffers are edited in `text-mode' by default; to use a different
major mode, change `edit-server-default-major-mode' or customize
`edit-server-url-major-mode-alist' to specify major modes based
on the remote URL:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (setq edit-server-url-major-mode-alist
  ;;       '(("github\\.com" . markdown-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* Alternatively, set the mode in `edit-server-start-hook'.  For
example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; (add-hook 'edit-server-start-hook
  ;;          (lambda ()
  ;;            (when (string-match "github.com" (buffer-name))
  ;;              (markdown-mode))))
#+END_SRC
