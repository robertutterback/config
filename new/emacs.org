#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Robert Utterback

Previously I had my Emacs configuration is a whole set of =.org= files
and used babael to load them. But I have come to the conclusion that
such a setup is not really worthwhile since I'm writing the files in
org mode anyway. So I've switched back to a single file and used it as
an opportunity to reevaluate my config.

Notes to self:
- don't put keybindings in their own place. Put them in related sections.
